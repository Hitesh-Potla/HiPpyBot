# LLM from Scratch  

Welcome to the **LLM from Scratch** project! This repository contains the implementation and training pipeline for a 200-million-parameter Large Language Model (LLM), designed as a conversational AI or chatbot. The project aims to explore the intricacies of building a transformer-based language model from the ground up, optimizing it for meaningful human-like interactions.  

## About the Project  

This project demonstrates the process of creating a large-scale language model from scratch, leveraging modern techniques in deep learning and natural language processing (NLP). It's designed to be a foundation for understanding LLM architectures and a platform for experimenting with training, fine-tuning, and deployment for conversational applications.  

**Core Objectives**:  
- Build a scalable, transformer-based architecture.  
- Train the model using large-scale datasets.  
- Focus on conversational AI applications, optimizing for relevance and coherence.
